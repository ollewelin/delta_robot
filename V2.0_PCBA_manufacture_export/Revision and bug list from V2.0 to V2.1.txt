Revision history:
From V2.0 to V2.1 2025-07-27
1. Fix FATAL bug Replace 1.1V FPGA power supply TPS62840 to ..41 for correct 1.1V supply (not 2.5 with old ..40)
2. Fix bug missing GND connection at 3.3V suply circuit. U23 pin-2 was not connected.
3. Fix bug rewire EN at U23 pin-3 now hard wired to 5V.
4. Fix bug. Swap Silk screen comment BOOT_MODE0 and 1
5. Swap POR_B hi/low Pull up 3.3 reset to GND
6. Fix bug missed connect the N6 Ball should be connecte to same as P6 according to Teensy USB1 OTG wound not work without this N6 attached
7. DCDC_PSWITCH need a toggle reset pin. Weak 10k pull up to 3.3V and pull down to GND to reset.
8. Fix FATAL bug. VCCA_BR rewired to 1.2V (not 3.3V fry the gclk clock grid)
9. Fix power rail bug swap power to F10,F4 to now F10, VCCIO3A_3B to 3.3V and F4 VCCIO1E to 1.8V
10. R12 pull up instead of pull down. Also add a program push buttom switch SW2 for pull down pulse to make USB1 blank programming mode possible.
